Font rendering todo:

- make an index buffer and render indexed (that makes it go faster i think)


------- this below is old ------------


First goal:

- Shader needs to have:

Todo:

- do a bindgroupthing::new
- try to generlize the texture and camera creation too

- make the game respect one static aspect ratio regardless of window res

Ralith:

it doesn't have to be complicated or abstract, your renderer can deeply
encode knowledge of the structure of your game
the point is that the game doesn't encode knowledge of the renderer

------ how to make the next block randomness ----

just keep a list of piece types [L, J, S, Z, T, O, I] and an index = 0,
shuffle the list when index == 0 and index = (index + 1) % piece_types.length each time

every next piece you generate will just be the next in the list
and each time you reach the end of the list, you reset the index to 0 and re-shuffle
so that next time you iterate over the list it will be random again
